Data Sources
number of operators in Permian Basin annually: Texas Rail Road Commission Oil & Gas Data Query - General Production Query
(http://webapps2.rrc.texas.gov/EWA/productionQueryAction.do)
Searching the production data by year long intervals, one can see the number of Operators producing oil in a given year.
a map of volume and number of oil spills by county: Texas RRC - Crude Oil, Gas Well Liquids or Associated Products (H-8) Loss Reports (http://www.rrc.state.tx.us/oil-gas/compliance-enforcement/h-8/)

Future Outlook
annual water injected: an analysis of cumulation, "H-10 Annual Disposal/Injection Well Monitoring Reports" of all operators would provide a market insight as to the demmand for water treatment systems. This would require a data extraction method to pull the data from the individual H-10 reports on the RRC website that are in PDF format.

Total number of unique operators to ever operate in the permian basin: such a figure would be simple to produce, using the operator


a map of volume and number of oil spills by county: an analysis could be furthered by determining which county has the largst/smallest sized oil spills.
